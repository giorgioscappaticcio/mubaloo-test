# mubaloo-test
To generate the files project I used Yeoman with Angular generator. 
As requested you can find the cordova files within a folder colled "cordova".

To run the project
- Step1: git clone https://github.com/giorgioscappaticcio/mubaloo-test; 
- Step2: cd within the project's folder and run   npm install (you need to have installed yo, grunt-cli, and bower) and then     bower install;
- Step3: you can run the project in localhost with the command "grunt serve" or build the project with "grunt build"


For ios emulator if the project get stuck on the loading image you should change your location option to "Apple" in the Debug dropdown.
